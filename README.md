# DOT2
Webtool to organize periodically recurring duties in a roster, e.g. like shifts or household tasks

The name is derived from Depot-Organisations-Tool, which I created for the CSA (commuunity supported agriculture) in Bonn. I was just not inventive enough to think of another name, that would express the use of this tool clear enough and without collision with other tools.

D-O-T is a web-based tool to assign duties to members of a depot, where the vegetables from the farm are delivered once a week. The produce must be unloaded from the van and than distributed from the large transport boxes to small baskets for the 50+ members of the depot, so that people can just fetch their share. This takes usually 3 people. After the distribution the place must be cleaned up by 2 people.

D-O-T was created to assign the tasks fairly among all members, so that everyone would have a service only 2-3 times a year. After an initial assignment of every member to services at several dates, members can reject the suggested dates, thus freeing that appointment for somebody else to trade.

Other features are reminder emails for the next shift and for unassigned/rejected services, either automated or manually triggered.

The original tool is very specialized to handle the CSA depot case, with weekly recurrance and 3, resp. 2 persons for the tasks. D-O-T-2 is supposed to be more flexible in these aspects.
